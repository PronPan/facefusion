# A Letter to FaceFusion's Creator

Henry,

You banned me from the Discord and accused me of *"siding with the competition"* just because I began tinkering with VisoMaster. When you asked why I would put time into VisoMaster and not FaceFusion, I explained I saw some of its advantages and it helped me understand how things could be improved for FaceFusion. Crucially, I also explained that I was hesitant to contribute to FaceFusion given some of our differences, your attitude, and the reputation you've established online.

You tried to treat me like a subordinate, and guilt trip me for not spending my free time working on FaceFusion. Even though I constantly assured you I was "loyal" to FaceFusion, and *did* in fact dedicate a lot of my time trying to help. Then I got busy with my disability, school/work, and understandably found myself doing other things. Just to have you crawl back to my DMs, call me incompetent, and effectively block me each time so I couldn't respond... And you wonder why you felt "disappointed" after I repeatedly ghosted you during the period I tried to be helpful. Truthfully, Henry, 9 times of 10 you're an insufferable a**hole unless the other person is actively worshipping you. You legitimately have the communication skills of a toddler.

It's obvious you felt threatened because you saw the genuine work I put into VisoMaster's Job Manager mod. Is this the "copying" you're talking about? It's insane to think a fully custom job manager, which I spent time and effort uniqely developing for VisoMaster, could be seen as "copying". I had no idea helping them with such simple, standard functionality, would get you so worked up and aggressive. It's incredibly petty and a bit delusional. 

Your adamant use of the word "competition" is ironic, considering both VisoMaster and FaceFusion are open source and encourage community development. I can assure you no other *truly* open source, community-made project sees this as a competition. But that's apparent from your need to profit off FaceFusion, restricting fundamental resources like a .EXE installer behind a paywall. That's not community-minded, it's not open source thinking, nor is it understandable from a "compensate the developer" viewpoint. It's just flexing your ignorance and true intentions for everyone to see. Which, based off the first few public threads that appear when Googling "FaceFusion", they certainly have.

You say this is your full time job, but the dev branch sits untouched for days or multiple weeks at a time. Then you go around treating everyone like they owe you something and should be grateful you'd even speak to them. I suggest you either earn that attitude by close-sourcing the project and taking complete control, or lowering your expectations for people who are willing to deal with that sh*t for free and under scrutiny.

You developed some great software, but unfortunately FaceFusion's growth is limited by your ego's control over how you handle the project and present yourself. I'll be using this experience as newfound motivation to fully develop a new "competitor" *(as you prefer to call free, open-source projects)* with some much needed improvements.

Congrats on the new model announcement.
